Tile Merger - November 2011
Release c1

Requires .NET 2.0 to run

The tile merger is a GUI application that takes a folder full of image files and mergers them into a single tiled image. Use the columns field to set the number of tiles per row. The image size is automatically calculated based on the source images. Images are sorted by their filename. I suggest using a numeric prefix naming scheme such as "001 tree.png", "002 table.png", "003 chair.png" etc. in order to predictably position images.
